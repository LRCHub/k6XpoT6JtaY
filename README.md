# siraph – 想像の雨

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I feel the world's descending from the sky
Pulse of lies over your eyes. An instant night
Intoxicated by the pain in this complicated universe
Illuminated by the haze. Will you let me through into that heart?

My life, my conclusion
It's the same, the same, the same, the same without you
That's somehow to feel you
In the quiet, quiet closed off mind

Like the summer sky covered by
Hard to amount, amount, amount, amount the fragrance
I dream of you in the rain
Like the way that we used to be

I feel the world's descending from the sky
Pulse of lies over your eyes. An instant night
Intoxicated by the pain in this complicated universe
Illuminated by the haze. Will you let me through into that heart?

My life, my conclusion
It's the same, the same, the same, the same without you
That's somehow to feel you
In the quiet, quiet closed off mind

Like the summer sky covered by
Hard to amount, amount, amount, amount the fragrance
I dream of you in the rain
Like the way that we used to be
